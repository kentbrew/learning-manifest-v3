## The Show So Far

✅ *[Canary Setup](https://github.com/kentbrew/learning-manifest-v3/blob/master/canary_setup.md)*<br>
If you're like me, you a) dislike the taste of coal dust and therefore b) have never even tried Chrome Canary.

🤷 *[Episode One: Initializing Some Things and our First Nasty Surprise](https://github.com/kentbrew/learning-manifest-v3/blob/master/ep_001.md)*<br>
Well ... crap. There's an Errors button in the UI bar.

✅ *[Episode Two: Permission to Run](https://github.com/kentbrew/learning-manifest-v3/blob/master/ep_002.md)*<br>

💩 *[Episode Three: Browser Button and Default Pop-Up](https://github.com/kentbrew/learning-manifest-v3/blob/master/ep_003.md)*<br>
`'action' requires trunk channel or newer, but this is the canary channel`

🤷 *[Episode Four: Executing Scripts](https://github.com/kentbrew/learning-manifest-v3/blob/master/ep_004.md)*<br>
Along the way we get a service worker installed, but there's an important caveat.
