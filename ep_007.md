# Episode Seven: The Persistence of Memory

Something we've come to depend on over the years: background processes keep running in the background. This means we can reasonably expect to be able to set a variable, go away for a while, and (assuming the browser hasn't been restarted) count on that variable to be there untouched upon our return.

## V2 Baseline

Here's our [manifest](https://github.com/kentbrew/learning-manifest-v3/blob/master/ep_007/v2/manifest.json), which will allow our context menu to appear over all URLs. (This is not required; as soon as `v3.manifest.action` lands in Canary I'll fix it up.)

```
{
  "name": "Baseline",
  "description": "Manifest V2 Baseline",
  "version": "0.1.107",
  "permissions": ["contextMenus", "<all_urls>"],
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["js/background.js"]
  },
  "manifest_version": 2
}
```

Here's our [background script](https://github.com/kentbrew/learning-manifest-v3/blob/master/ep_007/v2/js/background.js), which creates a context menu item and logs a count of clicks made during this browsing session:

```
// Initialize click counter
let clickCounter = 0;
console.log("V2 Baseline: initialized test click counter to 0");

// create a menu item
chrome.contextMenus.create({
  id: "BaselineV2",
  title: "V2 Baseline",
  // show the menu over everything
  contexts: ["all"]
});

// what to do when our menu is clicked
chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener(event => {
  // bump the count
  clickCounter = clickCounter + 1;
  // let us know it worked
  console.log("V2 Baseline: updated baseline click counter to " + clickCounter);
});
```

### Things to Do and Notice

- Open `chrome://extensions` and be sure Developer Mode (top right) is active.
- Drag `ep_007/v2` into `chrome://extensions` to install.
- Inspect the background page and switch to the Console tab.
- Observe the message `V2 Baseline: initialized test click counter to 0`.
- Right-click on `chrome://extensions` and choose the V2 Baseline context menu.
- Observe the message `V2 Baseline: updated baseline click counter to 1`.
- Do this a few more times and either restart Chrome or reload the extension.
- Inspect the background page and observe that the counter has restarted at zero.

## V3 Test

Because our extension won't maintain anything in memory when it stops and restarts, we're going to use local storage to maintain our state. Our background script (as of this writing) must be in the extension's root directory instead of the usual `/js` subdirectory. Here's our [manifest](https://github.com/kentbrew/learning-manifest-v3/blob/master/ep_007/v3/manifest.json):

```
{
  "name": "Test",
  "description": "Manifest V3 Test",
  "version": "0.1.107",
  "permissions": ["contextMenus", "storage"],
  "host_permissions": ["<all_urls>"],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "manifest_version": 3
}
```

We're going to use `chrome.storage.local` to keep track of our click count. But! Because local storage is persistent across sessions, we're going to need to listen for `chrome.runtime.onStartup` to initialize it to zero for each session.

Here's our [background script](https://github.com/kentbrew/learning-manifest-v3/blob/master/ep_007/v3/background.js)

```
// listen for extension install
chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  // create a menu item
  chrome.contextMenus.create({
    id: "TestV3",
    title: "V3 Test",
    // show the menu over everything
    contexts: ["all"]
  });
});

// listen for a browser session start
chrome.runtime.onStartup.addListener(() => {
  // initialize the click counter to zero
  chrome.storage.local.set({ clickCounter: 0 }, function() {
    // let us know it worked
    console.log("V3 Test: initialized test click counter to 0");
  });
});

// what to do when our menu is clicked
chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener(event => {
  // get the current value
  chrome.storage.local.get("clickCounter", result => {
    // bump the count
    result.clickCounter = result.clickCounter + 1;
    // update local storage
    chrome.storage.local.set({ clickCounter: result.clickCounter }, function() {
      // let us know it worked
      console.log(
        "V3 Test: updated test click counter to " + result.clickCounter
      );
    });
  });
});
```

### Things to Do and Notice

- Open `chrome://extensions` and be sure Developer Mode (top right) is active.
- Drag `ep_007/v3` into `chrome://extensions` to install.
- Open `chrome://serviceworker-internals`, find your worker, and click Inspect.
- In the inspector, switch to the Console tab.
- Observe the message `V3 Test: initialized test click counter to 0`.
- Right-click in `chrome://serviceworker-internals` and choose the V3 Test context menu.
- Observe the message `V3 Test: updated baseline click counter to 1`.
- From `chrome://serviceworker-internals` with your inspector window still open, suspend your worker by clicking Stop.
- Observe that your inspector window goes dark with a message that DevTools was disconnected.
- Right-click in `chrome://serviceworker-internals` and choose the V3 Test context menu.
- Observe that your inspector window lights back up again with an increased value for your click counter
- Reload your extension in `chrome://extensions`.
- Observe that your inspector window goes dark again. It's disconnected and won't come back since its instance of `background.js` has gone.
- Return to `chrome://serviceworker-internals` and click Inspect.
- Right-click in `chrome://serviceworker-internals` and choose the V3 Test context menu.
- Observe that your click counter has not reset, because local storage persists during extension reloads and reloading the extension does not fire `chrome.runtime.onStartup`.
- Restart Chrome.
- Open `chrome://serviceworker-internals`, find your worker, and click Inspect.
- In the inspector, switch to the Console tab.
- Observe that the counter has restarted at zero.

## Learnings

- If you're only installing context menus once, listen for `chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener` first.  (Hat tip:  Dave Bertoni.)
- Otherwise remember context menus are global and do not go away when the background script suspends. If you don't do something like `chrome.contextMenus.removeAll()` on startup you will see an error.
- Extension reloads do not overwrite local storage, nor do they fire the `chrome.runtime.onStartup` event.
- If you're currently logging browser session starts from your V2 extension, you'll need to listen for `chrome.runtime.onStartup` instead of pinging when your background script starts running.

## Current Status

Looks good from here. Seems like these restrictions will encourage smarter coding behavior and better awareness of how some global events and systems behave.
